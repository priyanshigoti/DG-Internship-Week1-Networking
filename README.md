# 🌐 Networking Basics – Task 1

This repository contains my notes and practice work for **basic networking concepts**.  
It covers the **OSI & TCP/IP models, common protocols, basic commands, and client-server communication**.

---

## 📌 Tasks

1. Study **OSI & TCP/IP Models**  
2. Learn **Common Protocols** – HTTP, FTP, DNS, DHCP, SSH  
3. Practice **Basic Commands** – ping, traceroute, netstat, ipconfig/ifconfig  
4. Write a short report on **Client-Server Communication**

## 📖 OSI & TCP/IP Models

- **OSI Model** has 7 layers: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical.  
- **TCP/IP Model** has 4 layers: Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access.  
- Both explain **how data moves across a network** from one device to another.

## 🌍 Common Protocols

- **HTTP/HTTPS** → Used for browsing websites  
- **FTP** → Transfer files between computers  
- **DNS** → Converts website names into IP addresses  
- **DHCP** → Automatically gives devices an IP address  
- **SSH** → Secure remote login to servers

## 💻 Basic Commands

Some useful networking commands:  

```bash
ping google.com          # Check connectivity
traceroute google.com    # Show path of packets (Linux)
tracert google.com       # Show path of packets (Windows)
netstat -an              # Show network connections
ipconfig /all            # Show IP info (Windows)
ifconfig / ip addr show  # Show IP info (Linux)

🔄 Client-Server Communication

Client = requests information (example: your browser).
Server = provides information (example: a website).
👉 Example: When you open amazon.com, your browser (client) asks Amazon’s servers for product details. The server replies with the webpage, and you see it on your screen.
